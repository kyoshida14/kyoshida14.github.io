## Previous research
### Perceptual-Motor Recalibration in Naturalistic and Virtual Environments
Abstract:
The way people learn to interact with the physical world can be conceptualized as a perception-action loop. For new situations, existing schemes are used to make predictions, take actions, and adjust actions based on the feedback. Through this system, people can adapt their motions, such as walking and turning, as environmental conditions change. This locomotive recalibration has been investigated in several experiments in the naturalistic environment. However, there has been less research examining recalibration effects in immersive virtual environments which allow for studies with lower costs and smaller facilities. Further experiments in virtual environments are necessary in order to gain a better understanding of the processes underlying recalibration effects. The present research investigated 1) how perceptions and actions work together and 2) how people respond differently to virtual and naturalistic environments. Specifically, it examined whether a recalibration effect created in a virtual environment had the same characteristics as rotational locomotion in the naturalistic environment. It followed the designs of previous experiments in naturalistic environments and consisted of a pre-test, recalibration phase, and a post-test. The results indicated that there is the same recalibration effect in naturalistic and virtual environments, and rotational recalibration effects transfer between naturalistic and virtual contexts.
