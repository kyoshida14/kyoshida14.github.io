Hello! I'm Kei Yoshida (吉田 慶 in Japanese; pronounced /ˈkeɪ/, just like the letter K), and I am a PhD candidate in cognitive science at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brown University</a> (Providence, RI, USA). I work with <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wwarrenj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. William H. Warren</a> in the Virtual Environment Navigation Lab (<a href="https://sites.brown.edu/venlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VENLab</a>), Department of Cognitive and Psychological Sciences (<a href="https://copsy.brown.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoPsy</a>).

I am also pursuing a concurrent master's degree in computer science (<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brown CS</a>) through the <a href="https://graduateschool.brown.edu/phd-experience/collaborative-research/open-graduate-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Graduate Education program</a>.

My research interests lie in how individual people in motion perceive and act in dynamic environments. In my PhD research, I investigate how pedestrians influence each other's movement, and how these interactions propagate to shape the collective dynamics of crowds. I am focusing on uncovering the dynamic interaction mechanism in crowds using networks, and investigating the effects of assigned leaders on crowd motions. Please check out <a href="/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my research work here</a>.

Before joining the VENLab, I earned my B.A. in computer science and psychology at <a href="https://www.coe.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coe College</a> (Cedar Rapids, IA, USA). I worked with <a href="https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/psychology/faculty#:~:text=Ben%20Chihak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Benjamin Chihak</a>, who introduced me to the world of navigation and locomotion research in the natural and virtual environment.
