Welcome! I'm Kei Yoshida (吉田慶 in Japanese; pronounced /ˈkeɪ/ just like the letter K), and I am a 4th-year PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/home) at Brown University. I work with [Dr. William H. Warren](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wwarrenj) in the [Virtual Environment Navigation Lab (VENLab)](https://sites.brown.edu/venlab/).

In my [research](/research/), I investigate how collective motion dynamically emerges from local visual interactions of individual agents. I am particularly interested in how a pedestrian influences the behavior of other pedestrians and how these leader-follower interactions change over time.

Before joining the VENLab, I earned my B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology at Coe College. I worked with [Dr. Benjamin Chihak](https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/psychology/faculty), who introduced me to the world of research in navigation and locomotion in natural and virtual environment.
