Welcome! I'm Kei Yoshida (吉田慶 in Japanese; pronounced /ˈkeɪ/, just like the letter K), and I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Cognitive & Psychological Sciences (CoPsy)](https://copsy.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I work with [Dr. William H. Warren](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wwarrenj) in the [Virtual Environment Navigation Lab (VENLab)](https://sites.brown.edu/venlab/).

I am also pursuing a master's degree in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.brown.edu/) through the [Open Graduate Education Program](https://graduateschool.brown.edu/phd-experience/collaborative-research/open-graduate-education).

For my [research](/research/), I investigate how collective motion dynamically emerges from local visual interactions of individual pedestrians. I am particularly interested in how pedestrians influence the behaviors of other pedestrians and how these leader-follower interactions change over time.

Before joining the VENLab, I earned my B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology at [Coe College](https://www.coe.edu). I worked with [Dr. Benjamin Chihak](https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/psychology/faculty), who introduced me to the world of navigation/locomotion research in natural and virtual environment.
