Hello! I'm Kei Yoshida (吉田 慶 in Japanese; pronounced /ˈkeɪ/, just like the letter K), and I am a PhD candidate in cognitive science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) (Providence, RI, USA). I work with [Dr. William H. Warren](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wwarrenj) in the Virtual Environment Navigation Lab ([VENLab](https://sites.brown.edu/venlab/)), Department of Cognitive and Psychological Sciences ([CoPsy](https://copsy.brown.edu/)).

I am also pursuing a concurrent master's degree in computer science ([Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/)) through the [Open Graduate Education program](https://graduateschool.brown.edu/phd-experience/collaborative-research/open-graduate-education).

My research interests lie in how individual people in motion perceive and act in dynamic environments. In my PhD research, I investigate how pedestrians influence each other's movement, and how these interactions propagate to shape the collective dynamics of crowds. I am focusing on uncovering the dynamic interaction mechanism in crowds using networks, and investigating the effects of assigned leaders on crowd motions. Please check out [my research work here](/research/).

Before joining the VENLab, I earned my B.A. in computer science and psychology at [Coe College](https://www.coe.edu) (Cedar Rapids, IA, USA). I worked with [Dr. Benjamin Chihak](https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/psychology/faculty#:~:text=Ben%20Chihak), who introduced me to the world of navigation and locomotion research in the natural and virtual environment.
